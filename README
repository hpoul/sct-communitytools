similiar websites designed to be easily pluggable into any django 
project to build.
It currently consists of a forum, wiki and blog application.

are using (e.g. by executing: python setup.py install) please provide
feedback on http://sct.sphene.net/ or herbert.poul@gmail.com if it

### Python library path

You need to add sphenecoll/ to your python include path.

cronjob to run once a day (or similar)

    /path/to/your/django/project/manage.py sph_maintenance

SCT makes use of django caching framework - it is therefore advised to 
configure CACHE_BACKEND django setting & co.

## Examples

There are currently two examples - a very simplistic 'simpleproject' in the
examples/ directory (see examples/simpleproject/README) and a more
sophisticated example called CommunityDraft which i recommend as using as a base for your
own projects (if you start from scratch).
